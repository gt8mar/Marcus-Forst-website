      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Uterine atony — the failure of the uterus to contract after delivery — is a leading
        cause of postpartum hemorrhage worldwide. Despite its clinical significance, the
        molecular mechanisms underlying atony remain poorly understood.
      </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Using Python, I analyzed proteomic and RNA-seq data from 21 patients with healthy
        and atonic uterine muscle. The analysis identifies proteins and genes that differ
        between the two groups, maps them onto biological pathways to find disrupted
        processes, and groups patients by molecular severity.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        The pipeline combines differential expression analysis with pathway enrichment to
        move beyond individual gene hits and identify systems-level dysfunction. Patient
        clustering reveals molecular subtypes that may respond differently to treatment.
      </p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        By identifying the specific molecular pathways disrupted in atonic uterine muscle,
        this work aims to reveal new targets for preventing or treating postpartum
        hemorrhage.
