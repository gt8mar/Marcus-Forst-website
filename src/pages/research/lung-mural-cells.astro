      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Mural cells — pericytes and smooth muscle cells — wrap around blood vessels in the
        lung and play critical roles in regulating blood flow and maintaining vascular
        structure. This project investigates how these cells change during lung development
        and in response to hyperoxia (high oxygen conditions).
      </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote Python tools to analyze imaging and transcriptomic data from lung tissue,
        enabling quantitative comparison of mural cell populations across developmental
        stages and oxygen conditions. The computational pipeline processes large datasets
        to identify shifts in cell type, distribution, and gene expression.
      </p>

      <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding how mural cells respond to hyperoxia is relevant to pulmonary
        hypertension and neonatal lung disease. By mapping these changes computationally,
        we aim to identify potential therapeutic targets.
