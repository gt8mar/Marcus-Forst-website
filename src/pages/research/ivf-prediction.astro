      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes depend on many factors, and clinicians
        currently lack reliable tools to predict which embryo transfers will succeed.
        This project builds machine learning models to estimate pregnancy success from
        preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) data.
      </p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        I cleaned and analyzed approximately 8,600 embryo records, linking PGT results
        with transfer outcomes to build a comprehensive training dataset.
      </p>

      <h2>Models and Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        The project produced predictive models and a Flask web application that allows
        clinicians to input embryo data and receive estimated transfer success
        probabilities. The tool is designed to support — not replace — clinical
        decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2>Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        As part of this project, I mentored a student through a Python crash course,
        designing a coding curriculum around the research so he could write the initial
        analysis before we scaled to larger models.
