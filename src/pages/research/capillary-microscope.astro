      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on designing a microscope to image white blood cells flowing
        through nailfold capillaries — the tiny blood vessels visible at the base of the
        fingernail. By watching individual blood cells move through these capillaries, we
        can study microvascular health non-invasively.
      </p>

      <h2>The Finger-Lock</h2>
      <p>
        A key challenge in capillary microscopy is motion: even small finger movements blur
        the video. I invented an inflatable "finger-lock" that stabilizes the finger under
        the microscope while also applying controlled pressure to modulate blood flow
        velocities. This device enables both clearer imaging and the study of how capillary
        flow responds to pressure changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote and received approval for an IRB protocol to study blood flow in healthy
        individuals and those with vascular conditions. Over the course of the project,
        I recruited and tested 82 participants.
      </p>

      <h2>Analysis Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        I developed an open-source Python and ImageJ pipeline
        (<a href="https://github.com/gt8mar/capillary-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capillary-flow</a>)
        to stabilize video, segment capillaries, and extract blood flow velocities from
        each frame. The pipeline handles the full workflow from raw video to quantitative
        flow measurements.
